# Proposed Features

This is the working backlog for features that would make contextdb more useful, inspectable, and durable as a live system.

## Current Next Steps

| Feature | Why it belongs | First useful slice |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Indexed pending/idempotency events | Recovery scans should remain bounded as history grows | Add keyed event indexes and verify lookup parity |
| Recovery failure injection | Durable recovery needs stronger failure evidence | Inject graph/vector/log failures and verify manual conflict lanes |
| Reviewer operations UI | Candidate approval and worker runs need an operator surface | Show candidate state, worker decisions, and explicit approve/reject controls |

2. Docker-backed Postgres integration suite for migrations, fingerprint indexes, feedback, and vector retrieval.
3. Ranking golden tests for namespace modes and representative corpora. Implemented for belief-system and agent-memory presets in v0.4.0; representative corpus coverage landed in v0.11.1.
4. API contract parity tests across Go SDK, REST, gRPC, and GraphQL. Expanded in v0.4.0 with gRPC public contract and REST failure-path coverage.
5. Failure injection for unavailable vector stores, graph stores, embedders, and malformed API requests.
6. Long-running race/soak tests for concurrent writes, reads, feedback, dedup, and compaction.

## Versioning Approach

The current docs should stay latest-first, with release recap pages and feature tags. Full multi-version docs become worthwhile once there are multiple supported release lines with incompatible APIs.
