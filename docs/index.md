    title: Facts expire
    details: Bi-temporal storage tracks when facts were true and when the system learned them. Point-in-time queries are first-class.
  - icon: <i class="fa-solid fa-shield-halved"></i>
    title: Sources lie
    details: Bayesian credibility tracking with an admission gate. Sources earn or lose trust based on how their claims hold up.
  - icon: <i class="fa-solid fa-hourglass-half"></i>
    title: Memory decays
    details: Episodic memories fade in hours. Procedural skills persist for months. Background workers consolidate knowledge automatically.
  - icon: <i class="fa-solid fa-code-compare"></i>
    title: Contradictions happen
    details: Conflicting claims detected at write time, tracked as graph edges, and scored during retrieval. The system knows what it disagrees about.

::: tip Current release
contextdb is currently `v0.123.0`: usable for serious demos and early integrations, but intentionally pre-1.0 while the public API, deployment modes, and SDK contracts continue to settle.

## Five lines to a working database

Zero external dependencies. No Docker. No config files. One `go get` and you're running. Auto-embedding lets you skip the vector. Just send text.

::: code-group
```go [Go]
db := client.MustOpen(client.Options{})
defer db.Close()

ns := db.Namespace("my-app", namespace.ModeGeneral)
ns.Write(ctx, client.WriteRequest{
    Content:  "Go 1.22 added routing patterns to net/http",
    SourceID: "docs-crawler",
})
results, _ := ns.Retrieve(ctx, client.RetrieveRequest{
    Text: "What changed in Go 1.22?", TopK: 5,
})
```

```python [Python]
from contextdb import ContextDB

db = ContextDB("http://localhost:7701")
ns = db.namespace("my-app", mode="general")
ns.write(content="Go 1.22 added routing patterns", source_id="docs-crawler")
results = ns.retrieve(text="What changed in Go 1.22?", top_k=5)
```

```typescript [TypeScript]
import { ContextDB } from "contextdb";

const db = new ContextDB("http://localhost:7701");
const ns = db.namespace("my-app", "general");
await ns.write({ content: "Go 1.22 added routing patterns", sourceId: "docs-crawler" });
const results = await ns.retrieve({ text: "What changed in Go 1.22?", topK: 5 });
```

```bash [curl]
# Write
curl -X POST http://localhost:7701/v1/namespaces/my-app/write \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content": "Go 1.22 added routing patterns", "source_id": "docs-crawler"}'

# Retrieve
curl -X POST http://localhost:7701/v1/namespaces/my-app/retrieve \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "What changed in Go 1.22?", "top_k": 5}'

## The scoring function

Every retrieval result is scored by a weighted combination of four dimensions:

```
score = w_sim  * cosine_similarity(candidate, query)
      + w_conf * confidence
      + w_rec  * exp(-alpha * age_hours)
      + w_util * utility_feedback
```

All weights are normalised at query time. You supply `alpha` (decay rate) and the four weights, or use namespace mode defaults.

## Deployment modes

| Mode | Backend | Use case |
|:-----|:--------|:---------|
| **Embedded** | In-memory or BadgerDB | Development, testing, sidecars, CLIs |
| **Standard** | Postgres + pgvector | Production single-node, teams |
| **Remote** | gRPC to contextdb server | Microservices, multi-language clients |
| **Scaled** | Qdrant + Redis + Postgres | High-throughput production |

## Namespace modes

| Mode | Best for | Key weight |
|:-----|:---------|:-----------|
| `belief_system` | Fact tracking, poisoning resistance | confidence |
| `agent_memory` | Agentic workflows with task feedback | utility + recency |
| `general` | Balanced RAG, document retrieval | similarity |
| `procedural` | Skill and workflow storage | confidence, slow decay |
