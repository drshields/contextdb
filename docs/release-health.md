# Release Health

Release health records the confidence gates used for each tagged release. The latest docs remain forward-looking, while this page keeps a compact audit trail for tests, docs, and operational readiness.

## Current Gate

Run these checks before tagging a release:

| Gate | Command or evidence | Current expectation |
|:-----|:--------------------|:--------------------|
| Unit and integration tests | `go test -count=1 ./...` | Required for every release |
| Docs build | `npm run docs:build` | Required for every release |
| Patch hygiene | `git diff --check` | Required for every release |
| Ranking corpus | `TestRepresentativeCorpusRankingGolden` in `./internal/retrieval` | Required before ranking changes |
| Badger restart durability | `TestDB_BadgerRestartDurability` in `./pkg/client` | Required before storage or embedded-mode changes |
| API contract surface | gRPC, REST, and GraphQL server tests | Required before public API changes |
| Race and soak lane | `go test -race -count=1 ./internal/federation ./internal/retrieval ./pkg/client` and `TestNamespace_ConcurrentWriteRetrieveSoak` | Required in CI |
| Postgres integration | Docker-backed `pgvector/pgvector:pg16` with `go test -tags integration ./pkg/client` | Required in CI |
| Release health artifact | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` `release-health` job | Required before publishing release recap rows |

The CI workflow now writes `release-health/release-health.json` and `release-health/release-health-row.md` from the actual `test`, `build`, `durability`, `postgres integration`, and `docker` job results. Use the generated Markdown row as the source for release recap updates so the table follows verified CI evidence rather than hand-maintained status text.

The v0.109–v0.122 recaps are [unverified historical proposals](releases/index#unverified-historical-proposals), not passed releases. Implementation evidence is tracked in the [work unit plan](plans/reliability-review-work-unit).

## v0.123.0 local verification

The [reliability and review work unit](plans/reliability-review-work-unit) ships as v0.123.0 after v0.108.0. The local verification below is separate from CI-generated release summary rows and historical release claims.

| Gate | Result | Evidence |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Go suite | Passed | `go test -count=1 ./...` |
| Static analysis | Passed | `go vet ./...` |
| Race checks | Passed | Ingest, retrieval, client, and server packages |
| Postgres | Passed | Live Docker-backed write/retrieve and two-handle advisory lease tests |
| Workflow integration | Passed | Authenticated HTTP acquisition, repeated candidate execution, approval retry, worker dry run/execution, durable summaries, empty recovery backlog |
| Authentication | Passed | Real gRPC anonymous/forged/read-only rejection and valid-token tests |
| SDK contracts | Passed | TypeScript mocked contracts/build; Python sync/async mocks; existing opt-in live SDK cases remain separately skipped |
| Admin/docs builds | Passed | `npm run admin:build`, `npm run docs:build` |
| Container | Passed | Native arm64 Docker build; Postgres backend metadata; doctor sample write/retrieve; worker CLI dry run |
| Browser | Passed | Correct fixture claim/evidence render, nullable-array regression, baseline reload persistence and deletion |
| Independent review | Reviewed | Sol re-review cleared verified correctness findings after fixes |

## Interpreting Status

`Passed` means the gate was run during the local release slice before the commit and tag. `Present` means the release contains an automated test that covers the area, even if the table points to the broad suite rather than a single command.

Race and soak checks are not yet mandatory because they are slower and more environment-sensitive. They remain a recommended gate for storage, federation, compaction, or concurrent retrieval changes.
